# Math library for GLUE-Language C Compiler

A library of mathematical functions for GLUE languages such as Python and Ruby.  
It is a library for compilers, but independent. Include it so that the language compiler is importing it.  
(So it can be adopted by Fortran)  

* Features:  
	* Thread-safe design (POSIX-base)
	* Numerical Verification
	* Refined Math
	* Complex-number arithmetic (lower compatibility of C++)
	* Distribution Function Support
	* ANSI C Math Support (named as legacy)
	* Adopts C++ naming convention
